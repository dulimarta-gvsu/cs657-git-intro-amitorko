\# Course Reflection



\## What I Learned

I learned how to use Git and GitHub for version control, including cloning repositories, committing changes, pushing code, and creating pull requests. I also learned how GitHub Classroom works and how repositories are used in academic and professional settings.



\## What I Am Still Confused About

I am still confused about repository access permissions and how GitHub Classroom handles deadlines and repository availability. I would also like more practice with branching and resolving merge conflicts.
